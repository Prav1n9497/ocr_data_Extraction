# Ocr Data Extraction

**Introduction**
This project aims at developing a Streamlit application that allows users to pload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information is then displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, the application allows users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database is able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.
